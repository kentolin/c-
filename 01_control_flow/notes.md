### 01_CONTROL_FLOW Notes

✅ Learned:

- `if` / `else if` / `else` → conditional branching.
- `switch` → multiple-choice selection using integers/chars.
- `for`, `while`, `do-while` → repeating tasks.
- Nested loops = loops inside loops.

💡 Observations:

- Forgetting `break` in switch causes “fallthrough.”
- Be careful of infinite loops (while condition always true).
- `do-while` runs at least once, even if condition false.

🧩 Challenge ideas:

1. Print all even numbers between 1 and 100.
2. Find factorial of a number.
3. Build a small number-guessing game.
