### 04_TEMPLATES_STL Notes

✅ Learned:

- Templates = generic programming (type-independent).
- STL containers: vector, map, set.
- STL algorithms: sort, find, accumulate.
- Lambda expressions = inline anonymous functions.

💡 Key takeaway:
STL = "Standard Template Library" built entirely using templates.
It saves time and ensures high performance.

🧩 Practice:

1. Template function to find max of two numbers.
2. Vector of strings — sort alphabetically.
3. Map of countries to capitals.
4. Count even numbers in a vector using lambda.
5. Use `accumulate` to calculate average.
